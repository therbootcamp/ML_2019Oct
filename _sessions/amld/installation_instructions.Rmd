## Overview

This is a step by step guide to set you up for the *Applied Machine Learning with R* [course](https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/applied-machine-learning-with-r) taught at the [AMLD 2020](https://appliedmldays.org/) by [The R Bootcamp](https://therbootcamp.github.io/). For the course we will need *R*, *RStudio*, some *R packages*, as well as the datasets.


## Installations

### R

First we have to install R. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ and select the appropriate R version for your operating system. Download R and follow the installation guide.

#### Additional Software

##### Windows

If you have a windows operating system, you will also have to download and install *Rtools*. To this end, go to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/, download *Rtools35.exe* and install it. Alternatively, you can directly download it via this link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe.

##### Mac

If you work on a Mac OS, you need to install gfortran 6.1, and clang-7. To do so, visit this page https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ and download and install these two.


### RStudio

Now, let's install RStudio. To this end, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and select the appropriate *RStudio Desktop* installer for your OS and install it.

### Packages

Finally, we'll have to install a couple of packages that we will work with. To this end, open RStudio and enter the following code in the console panel (it is a tab labelled with *Console*):

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
source('https://tinyurl.com/rq9cp92')
```

If you are prompted whether you want to install packages from source, just type *n* and hit enter. This is safer (i.e. may avoid problems during package installation).

You will receive a final report from the script, telling you whether the necessary packages could be installed.

## Materials

The last step is to download the materials via this [link](https://therbootcamp.github.io/ML_2019Oct/_sessions/amld/RBootcamp_AMLD2020.zip) and to unzip and locate the folder somewhere you will be comfortable working with during the course.

That's it. See you at the course!
